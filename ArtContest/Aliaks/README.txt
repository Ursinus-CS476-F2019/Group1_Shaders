1. Aliaksandr Hladkou
2. I consent to have my art contest submission posted publicly on the class web site. My name/pseudonym for public display is Aliaks.
3. Half of the time took debugging. So, in total it took 4 days. However, solving the first part took only 20 minutes, and about 6-8 hours for the second task.
4. Results are impressive. There are many aspects that difficult to understand in order to get a specific goal completed, but again - results are impressive.
5. It is difficult to keep in mind of using float instead of int as well as of recursion. I feel this language to be very limited because always have to think of alternative ways of writing the code.

Instructions for creativity.frag:
I was using circle.frag file to complete art contest part. All code that in creativity.frag can be placed instead of circle.frag in circle.frag file.
