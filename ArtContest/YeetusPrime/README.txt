I consent to have my art contest submission posted publicly on the class web site. 
My name/pseudonym for public display is Yeetimus Prime.

The art contest piece is titled "Semi-Revolving Industries Logo:Simple but Eye Catching"

This assignment took approx. 2 hours. 

I think it was a great way to start getting used to GLSL and overall the ideas/results were really cool.
